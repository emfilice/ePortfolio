    <p>Over the course of my four years at UH, I&#39;ve had to complete many projects for my classes. These are some of the more impactful ones.</p>
    <h3>Post Office Database and Front-End Interface</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Languages/Frameworks used: MSSQL, ASP.NET</li>
        <li>Skills developed:<ul>
            <li>Database creation/management</li>
            <li>creating a front-end for databases</li>
            <li>Using git</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The goal of this project was to create a database with sufficient design to account for all the attributes and entities a real life post office would need to keep track of (such as customers, orders, employees etc.). I was placed in a group of five, and we coordinated our project over GitHub. It was my first time using GitHub, or git in any context, so I got first-hand experience with just about everything that could go wrong with merge conflicts.</p>
    <p>
        //note to Dr. Weber: will contain an embedded version of the front end (website) once I figure out how best to host it.
