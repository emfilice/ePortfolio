    <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
    <p>
        During the summer of 2017, I participated in Research Experience for Undergraduates, a summer program through the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. The program paired me up with Dr. Rakesh Verma, who guided me through the process of research. My topic was Received Field Analysis for Phishing Email Classification. The project is best summarized in the poster I made for the program.</p>
