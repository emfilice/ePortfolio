    <h1>Leadership</h1>
    <p>My main experiences with leadership come from my extracurriculars at UH. One organization I am in has provided me with more experiences than any of the rest, however.</p>
    <h3>Club Theatre</h3>
    <p>By far my favorite organization, and the one I&#39;ve devoted the most time to, Club Theatre has been my best experience for leadership so far. I&#39;ve been a director in the organization for two and a half years now, going on three, and it has provided me with countless opportunities to grow my leadership skills. As a director in club theatre, it is my job to, essentially, take a script and turn it into a show. Directors are in charge of casting their shows, organizing rehearsals every week, and making sure the show is in perfect shape--lines memorized, blocking made and learned--before show week. I&#39;ve had to deal with countless problems with my casts over the years, such as dealing with cast members who drop out, reining in a cast that is wasting too much rehearsal time, and stimulating a low-energy cast to produce a high-energy show. These skills are incredibly useful to build an ensemble team, and as software engineering is wholly dependent on the efficiency and synergy of teams, this experience would translate well into the workplace. Not only will it help me to contribute to an effective team, but it will also give me a headstart in managing them. Casting experience can translate into hiring ability, organizing rehearsals into coordinating meetings, and bringing up energy into raising morale.
        apply them to my work as well.
